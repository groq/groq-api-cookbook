    "In this notebook, we will showcase the concept of [Mixture of Agents (MoA)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.04692) using [Agno Agents](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno) and [Groq API](https://console.groq.com/playground). \n",

    "The Mixture of Agents approach involves leveraging multiple AI agents, each equipped with different language models, to collaboratively complete a task. By combining the strengths and perspectives of various models, we can achieve a more robust and nuanced result. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our project, multiple MLB Writer agents, each utilizing a different language model (`llama3-70b-8192`, `llama3-8b-8192`, `gemma2-9b-it`, and `mixtral-8x7b-32768`), will independently generate game recap articles based on game data collected from other Agno Agents. These diverse outputs will then be aggregated by an MLB Editor agent, which will synthesize the best elements from each article to create a final, polished game recap. This process not only demonstrates the power of collaborative AI but also highlights the effectiveness of integrating multiple models to enhance the quality of the generated content."

    "## About Agno\n",
    "\n",
    "Agno is a lightweight framework for building multi-modal Agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key features\n",
    "Hereâ€™s why you should build Agents with Agno:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lightning Fast: Agent creation is 5000x faster than LangGraph (see performance).\n",
    "- Model Agnostic: Use any model, any provider, no lock-in.\n",
    "- Multi Modal: Native support for text, image, audio and video.\n",
    "- Multi Agent: Delegate tasks across a team of specialized agents.\n",
    "- Memory Management: Store user sessions and agent state in a database.\n",
    "- Knowledge Stores: Use vector databases for Agentic RAG or dynamic few-shot.\n",
    "- Structured Outputs: Make Agents respond with structured data.\n",
    "- Monitoring: Track agent sessions and performance in real-time on agno.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "Join us on our [Discord server](https://agno.link/discord) where we are actively building with the community. \n"
