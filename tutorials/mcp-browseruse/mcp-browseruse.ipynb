    "# Groq + Browser Use MCP: Intelligent Product Comparison\n",
    "**The Problem:** Comparing products online means opening multiple tabs, checking various retailers, and manually tracking prices and features across different sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution:** This tutorial shows how to combine Groq's fast inference with Browser Use's Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to automatically research and compare products across multiple websites in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Browser Use MCP?\n",
    "Browser Use MCP enables AI models to autonomously browse websites, extract information, and interact with web pages. Think of it as giving your model the ability to:\n",
    "- Navigate websites and click links\n",
    "- Extract data from multiple sources\n",
    "- Compare information across retailers\n",
    "\n",
    "You can learn more about Browser Use at [browser-use.com](https://browser-use.com).\n",
