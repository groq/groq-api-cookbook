    "In this tutorial, we'll build a voice-powered AI application using Groq for realtime speech recognition and text generation and Gradio for creating an interactive web interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Groq](groq.com) is known for insanely fast inference speed that is very well-suited for realtime AI applications, providing multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) and speech-to-text models via Groq API. In this tutorial, we will use the [Distil-Whisper English](https://huggingface.co/distil-whisper/distil-large-v3) and [Llama 3.1 70B](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-models/blob/main/models/llama3_1/MODEL_CARD.md) models for speech-to-text and text-to-text. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to prototype and deploy interactive demos without needing to write frontend code for a nice User Interface (UI), which is great if you're a developer like me who doesn't know much about frontend Bob Ross-ery. 🖌️\n",

    "\n",
    "- Use Distil-Whisper English powered by Groq transcribe audio input in realtime.\n",
    "- Use Llama 3.1 70B powered by Groq to generate instant responses based on the transcription.\n",
    "- Create a Gradio interface to handle audio input and display results on a nice UI.\n",
