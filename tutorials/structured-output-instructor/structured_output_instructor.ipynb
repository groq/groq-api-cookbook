    "# Structured Output with Groq and Instructor\n",
    "While large language models (LLMs) are often employed for building chatbots or conversational agents, numerous real-world applications require a different approach - one that goes beyond mere dialogue and involves producing structured, machine-readable outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a typical scenario: we want to produce structured JSON data from an LLM. While tools like Python's `json` module allow us to handle this data, they also come with their own set of challenges, such as validating data types and ensuring consistency across outputs. Manually checking these aspects can be tedious and error-prone. LLMs also tend to forget to include a comma or a closing bracket ('}') somewhere in the produced JSON from time to time, which would invalidate the whole JSON output.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the Instructor library comes into play. If you've been using the recent feature of [structured outputs](https://openai.com/index/introducing-structured-outputs-in-the-api/) by OpenAI, then you'll feel at home using Instructor. By integrating the Instructor library with models powered by Groq, we can simplify the process of generating structured outputs, making it both easier and more reliable. This guide will walk you through setting up this integration, showcasing how to use structured outputs to generate synthetic data for evaluating LLM-powered applications - a powerful and practical use case for LLMs."

    "## 1. A Very Simple Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive right into how you can set up the `instructor` library with Groq models to generate structured JSON outputs. We'll keep it simple and straightforward so you can get up and running quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grabbing Your API Key\n",
    "\n",
    "Before doing anything, grab your Groq API key from [Groq console](https://console.groq.com/keys) and put it in an `.env` file alongside this notebook:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "GROQ_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing the Necessary Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Install the required Python libraries. You'll need:\n",
    "- groq\n",
    "- instructor\n",
    "- python-dotenv (for loading environment variables)\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the following command to install the libraries:\n",

    "pip install -U groq instructor python-dotenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extracting Structured Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a very simple use case. Imagine you want to extract user details like name, age, and email from a piece of text that you have. To extract this information, you could utilize a JSON schema to define the structure of the user data and pass it to a Groq model (for example, by passing `response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"}` to the `chat.completions.create()` method). However, creating JSON schemas can be cumbersome. To facilitate this, instructor leverages the Pydantic library, a powerful tool that simplifies the process of describing the output structure of the model:"

This approach enhances not only the evaluation process but also helps identify edge cases where the agent might struggle, allowing you to refine its performance before deploying it in a real-world environment.\n",
