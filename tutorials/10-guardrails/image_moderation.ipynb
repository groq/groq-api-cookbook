    "# Groq and Gradio for Image Moderation with LLaVA and Llama Guard üì∑\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll build an image moderation application powered by Groq for fast image analysis and content safety checking. We'll also leverage [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) for creating a user-friendly interface and [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) for hosting our application.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Groq](groq.com) is known for crazy fast inference speed that is very well-suited for realtime AI applications, providing multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) across various modalities via Groq API. In this tutorial, we will use [LlaVA 1.5 7B](https://huggingface.co/liuhaotian/llava-v1.5-7b) for image analysis and [Llama Guard 3 8B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-Guard-3-8B) for assessing the safety of a given image.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Content Moderation\n",
    "In today's digital age, the internet is a ubiquitous part of our daily lives. However, with the vast amount of information available online, ensuring a safe and positive environment for users has become a significant challenge. This is where content moderation comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, image moderation is the process of detecting and filtering out inappropriate or harmful images. This is important for maintaining a safe and positive environment for users, especially in applications like online marketplaces, community forums, and social media in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use the LlaVA model to generate a description of a given image and use the generated description as input for the Llama Guard model to check for conteny safety. LlaVA is a state-of-the-art image understanding model that can answer questions about an image, describe its content, and perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from images. Llama Guard is an advanced content moderation tool designed to assess user messages, or text, for harmful content across 14 categories, including hate speech, threats, and misinformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive into the code and learn how to combine the capabilities of Llama Guard and LlaVA to moderate images in real-time!"
