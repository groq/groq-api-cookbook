## Groq and Composio

This guide demonstrates how to use Groq's LLMs with Composio. Composio provides pre-defined actions for a large number of applications like Gmail, Slack, GitHub etc. and allows us to create seamless integrations between these apps and LLMs/agents. Using these tools and actions, its very easy to create agents that need to interact with external applications.
