Overwhelmed by recent job loss, housing instability, and a language barrier, these factors exacerbate their sense of isolation.

After losing their job six months ago, the patient has faced significant challenges in finding new employment, exacerbated by a language barrier that complicates interviews and interactions. The resulting financial strain led to losing their apartment, and they are now staying temporarily with a friend in an unsafe area. This precarious living situation and limited ability to communicate have deepened their feelings of isolation. The patient mentioned, "It's hard when you can't fully express what you're going through." Public transportation is their only means of travel, which often adds to their stress, especially when language issues arise. Currently uninsured due to job loss, patient has dealt with food insecurity and worries about the costs of medication and medical care, having skipped their last visit due to the cost.

**Comments:** The patient's situation is complicated by financial issues, housing instability, and significant social challenges, including a language barrier and unhealthy coping mechanisms. A comprehensive and culturally sensitive approach is essential to address the multifaceted aspects of their care.
