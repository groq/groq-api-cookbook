Reproductions must be [short, self-contained and correct](http://sscce.org/) and must not contain files or code that aren't relevant to the issue. It's best if you use the sample app in `example/index.ts` as a starting point for your reproduction. We will prioritize issues that include a working minimal reproduction repository.
