    "\n",
    "To extend the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in AI-powered applications and systems, we can provide **tools** to allow them to interact with external resources (e.g. APIs, databases, web) by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Providing tools (or predefined functions) to our LLM\n",
    "- Defining how the tools we provide should be used to teach our LLM how to use them effectively (e.g. defining input and output formats)\n",
    "- Letting the LLM autonomously decide whether or not the provided tools are needed for a user query by evaluating the user query, determining whether the tools can enhance its response, and utilizing the tools accordingly\n",
    "\n",
    "By providing our LLMs with tools, we can enable them with the option to gather dynamic data that they wouldn't otherwise have access to in their pre-trained, or static, state. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Parallel Tool Use? 🧰\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take tool use a step further. Imagine a workflow where multiple tools can be used simultaneously, enabling more efficient and effective responses. This concept, known as **parallel tool use**, is key for building agentic workflows that can deal with complex queries and tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging parallelism, you can build applications that can call multiple tools concurrently and then combine the outputs of these tools in parallel for your application to provide an accurate response or complete a task for a complex query."
