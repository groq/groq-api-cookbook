According to the startup, the most capable in the family, Claude 3 Opus, outperforms rival models GPT-4 from OpenAI and Gemini 1.0 Ultra from Google on various benchmark exams. Sign up here. \\\"This is the Rolls-Royce of models, at least at this point in time,\\\" CEO Dario Amodei said in an interview. Advances from Anthropic's competitors have already been previewed or are expected, and Reuters was unable to verify the claims independently. The news, on the heels of myriad rival announcements and Anthropic's Claude 2 release in July, shows how companies are vying to top charts that rank AI performance, at the same time as business customers are still grappling with how to put such technology to use .\\nAnthropic's President Daniela Amodei said customers would opt for Claude 3 Opus despite a higher price tag \\\"if they had a need for the most cognitively complex tasks,\\\" for instance handling a complicated financial analysis accurately. Anthropic said it would charge $15 for Claude 3 Opus to take in every 1 million pieces of data known as tokens, and at least five times less for its smaller models to handle the same. By contrast, OpenAI charges $10 for each million tokens entered into its GPT-4 Turbo model. Anthropic also said Claude 3 is its first \\\"multimodal\\\" AI suite. This means, like some other rival models, Anthropic's AI can respond to text queries and to images, for instance analyzing a photo or chart. Popularized by OpenAI's ChatGPT, such \\\"generative\\\" AI creates new content on command. CEO Amodei said Claude 3 would examine, though not produce, images because \\\"we've seen much less enterprise demand for them.\\\" Google last month paused image-generation features for its Gemini chatbot after the service flubbed on diversity, like inaccurately depicting 1940s Nazi soldiers as having various racial backgrounds rather than being white. Anthropic said its Claude 3 models would be available via Amazon and Google's cloud platforms. It also would sell access to them directly, in 159 countries, Anthropic said.

To study diffusion patterns, we introduce the Anthropic AI Usage Index (AUI) to measure whether Claude.ai use is over- or underrepresented in an economy relative to its working age population. **We find:**\\n\\n* **The AUI strongly correlates with income across countries:** As with previous technologies, we see that AI usage is geographically concentrated.\\n ... \\nSee Jones, Jones, and Aghion, 2017 _Artificial Intelligence and Economic Growth_ for discussion of growth implications AI-powered automation of innovation. ## Chapter 1: Claude.ai usage over time\\n\\n### Overview\\n\\nUnderstanding how AI adoption evolves over time can help predict its economic impacts\u2014from productivity gains to workforce changes. With data spanning from December 2024 and January 2025 (from our first report, \u2018V1\u2019) to February and March 2025 (\u2018V2\u2019) to our newest insights from August 2025 (\u2018V3\u2019), we can track how AI usage has shifted over the past eight months as capabilities and product features have improved, new kinds of users have adopted the technology, and uses have become more sophisticated. We view the evidence presented below as suggesting that new product features have enabled new forms of work rather than simply accelerating adoption for existing tasks. ### How Claude.ai usage for economic tasks has changed\\n\\n#### Educational and scientific tasks continue their rise in relative importance\\n\\nWhile computer and mathematical tasks still dominate overall usage at 36%, we are seeing sustained growth in knowledge-intensive fields. Educational Instruction and Library tasks rose from 9% in V1 to 12% in V3. Life, Physical, and Social Science tasks increased from 6% to 7%.

Log in . * Anthropic announced a new AI tool that can control your computer and carry out simple tasks. * \\\"Computer use\\\" can move a cursor, type, and perform actions like filling out a form or ordering pizza. * The tool is still in beta and has some quirky results, like taking a 'break' to search for pictures of a park. [Anthropic](https://www.businessinsider.com/here-are-the-executives-running-anthropic-right-now-2024-10) has announced a major new update for Claude that means the AI model can take control of a computer to perform actions like moving cursors, typing out text, and browsing the internet.\\n ... \\nMollick also instructed it to create assignments based on Common Core, a set of educational standards for students, and to put them into a spreadsheet. He said that a chatbot would have needed his help to go through each step, whereas Claude downloaded a book, looked up lesson plans and Common Core standards online, and filled in the lesson plan spreadsheet. He said the results were \\\"not bad,\\\" and he didn't spot any obvious errors. He wrote, \\\"I simply delegated a complex task and walked away from my computer, checking back later to see what it did (the system is quite slow).\\\" Graphic design platform Canva is testing out computer use to see how it can help with design creation. Danny Wu, the company's head of AI products, told [VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/ai/anthropic-new-ai-can-use-computers-like-a-human-redefining-automation-for-enterprises/) that it's \\\"discovering time-savings within our team that could be game-changing for users.\\\" ## Use with caution\\n\\nAnthropic advises people to take precautionary measures when using the tool to prevent unintended consequences like a cyberattack. It recommends safeguards to prevent prompt injection, a type of cyberattack in which a person prompts an AI model to change its intended behavior for nefarious purposes.\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/28/anthropic-users-face-a-new-choice-opt-out-or-share-your-data-for-ai-training/\",\n      \"title\": \"Anthropic users face a new choice \u2013 opt out or share your ...\",\n      \"excerpts\": [\n        \"Last updated: Aug 28, 2025\\n[](mailto:?subject=Anthropic+users+face+a+new+choice+%E2%80%93+opt+out+or+share+your+chats+for+AI+training&body=Article%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F08%2F28%2Fanthropic-users-face-a-new-choice-opt-out-or-share-your-data-for-ai-training%2F) [](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/28/anthropic-users-face-a-new-choice-opt-out-or-share-your-data-for-ai-training/)\\n\\nAnthropic is making some big changes to how it handles user data, requiring all Claude users to decide by September 28 whether they want their conversations used to train AI models. While the company directed us to its [blog post](https://www.anthropic.com/news/updates-to-our-consumer-terms) on the policy changes when asked about what prompted the move, we\u2019ve formed some theories of our own. But first, what\u2019s changing: Previously, Anthropic didn\u2019t use consumer chat data for model training. Now, the company wants to train its AI systems on user conversations and coding sessions, and it said it\u2019s extending data retention to five years for those who don\u2019t opt out. That is a massive update. Previously, users of Anthropic\u2019s consumer products were told that their prompts and conversation outputs would be automatically deleted from Anthropic\u2019s back end within 30 days \u201cunless legally or policy\u2011required to keep them longer\u201d or their input was flagged as violating its policies, in which case a user\u2019s inputs and outputs might be retained for up to two years.\\n ... \\nUnder the Biden administration, the Federal Trade Commission even stepped in, [warning](https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advocacy-research/tech-at-ftc/2024/01/ai-companies-uphold-your-privacy-confidentiality-commitments) that AI companies risk enforcement action if they engage in \u201csurreptitiously changing its terms of service or privacy policy, or burying a disclosure behind hyperlinks, in legalese, or in fine print.\u201d\\n\\nWhether the commission \u2014 now operating with just [three](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/trump-fires-both-ftc-democrats-in-challenge-to-supreme-court-precedent/) of its five commissioners \u2014 still has its eye on these practices today is an open question, one we\u2019ve put directly to the FTC.\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://www.theverge.com/anthropic/773087/anthropic-to-pay-1-5-billion-to-authors-in-landmark-ai-settlement\",\n      \"title\": \"Anthropic to pay $1.5 billion to authors in landmark AI ...\",\n      \"excerpts\": [\n        \"Last updated: Sep 5, 2025\\nIn what\u2019s potentially the first major payout to creatives whose work was used to train AI systems, Anthropic has reached an agreement to pay \u201cat least\u201d a staggering $1.5 billion, plus interest, to authors to settle its class-action lawsuit. The amount breaks down to smaller payouts expected to be approximately $3,000 per book or work. Lawyers for the plaintiffs said it\u2019s \u201cbelieved to be the largest publicly reported recovery in the history of US copyright litigation.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cThis result is nothing short of remarkable,\u201d the [legal filing](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26084996-proposed-anthropic-authors-ai-settlement/) states. The settlement is subject to court approval, and a hearing will take place on September 8th. According to a press release, the final amount could be higher, in that approximately 500,000 works will likely be paid out, but if the total is higher than that, Anthropic will pay an additional $3,000 per work, and it all depends on the number of claims submitted. As part of the settlement, Anthropic must also destroy the original files it downloaded and any copies. \u201cThe settlement only releases claims based on past acts \u2013 it does not give Anthropic a license or permission for future AI training and it does not release any claims that arise after August 25, 2025,\u201d the release stated.

It\u2019s not the only legal action Anthropic has faced in recent years. This summer, Reddit filed suit against Anthropic, claiming that the AI company\u2019s bots had accessed Reddit more than 100,000 times since July 2024, after Anthropic had said it blocked them from doing so.\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use\",\n      \"title\": \"Introducing computer use, a new Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and ...\",\n      \"excerpts\": [\n        \"Last updated: Oct 22, 2024\\n[Skip to main content]() [Skip to footer]()\\n\\n[](/)\\n\\n* Claude\\n* API\\n* Solutions\\n* Research\\n* Commitments\\n* Learn\\n[News](/news)\\n\\n[Try Claude](https://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.f5bbe666-1428-4701-b12d-42b9ee68cf58)\\n\\nAnnouncements\\n\\n# Introducing computer use, a new Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Claude 3.5 Haiku\\n\\nOct 22, 2024 \u25cf 5 min read\\n\\nImage\\n\\n_Update (12/03/2024): We have revised the pricing for Claude 3.5 Haiku.

The upgraded Claude 3.5 Sonnet delivers across-the-board improvements over its predecessor, with particularly significant gains in coding\u2014an area where it already led the field. Claude 3.5 Haiku matches the performance of Claude 3 Opus, our prior largest model, on many evaluations at a similar speed to the previous generation of Haiku. We\u2019re also introducing a groundbreaking new capability in public beta: **computer use** . Available [today on the API](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/computer-use) , developers can direct Claude to use computers the way people do\u2014by looking at a screen, moving a cursor, clicking buttons, and typing text. Claude 3.5 Sonnet is the first frontier AI model to offer computer use in public beta. At this stage, it is still [experimental](https://www.anthropic.com/news/developing-computer-use) \u2014at times cumbersome and error-prone.\\nWe're releasing computer use early for feedback from developers, and expect the capability to improve rapidly over time. Asana, Canva, Cognition, DoorDash, Replit, and The Browser Company have already begun to explore these possibilities, carrying out tasks that require dozens, and sometimes even hundreds, of steps to complete. For example, Replit is using Claude 3.5 Sonnet's capabilities with computer use and UI navigation to develop a key feature that evaluates apps as they\u2019re being built for their Replit Agent product. The upgraded Claude 3.5 Sonnet is now available for all users. Starting today, developers can build with the computer use beta on the Anthropic API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud\u2019s Vertex AI. The new Claude 3.5 Haiku will be released later this month.

It has been OpenAI's biggest financial backer, having invested more than $13 billion into the AI startup and getting a head-start in the AI race due to the company's models. \\\"As we've said, OpenAI will continue to be our partner on frontier models and we remain committed to our long-term partnership,\\\" a Microsoft spokesperson said. Developers making Office AI features found Anthropic's latest models performed better than OpenAI in automating tasks such as financial functions in Excel or generating Powerpoint presentations based on instructions, the report said, citing one of the two people involved in the effort. Microsoft will pay its cloud rival Amazon Web Services to access the Anthropic models, according to the report. AWS is one of Anthropic's largest shareholders.

In the US alone, 40% of employees report using AI at work, up from 20% in 2023 two years ago. <sup>**1**</sup> Such rapid adoption reflects how useful this technology already is for a wide range of applications, its deployability on existing digital infrastructure, and its ease of use\\u2014by just typing or speaking\\u2014without specialized training. Rapid improvement of frontier AI likely reinforces fast adoption along each of these dimensions. Historically, new technologies took decades to reach widespread adoption. Electricity took over 30 years to reach farm households after urban electrification. The first mass-market personal computer reached early adopters in 1981, but did not reach the majority of homes in the US for another 20 years.\\n ... \\n* What determines AI adoption across countries and within the US? What can be done to ensure that the benefits of AI do not only accrue to already-rich economies? * What role, if any, does cost-per-task play in shaping enterprise deployment patterns? * Why are firms able to automate some tasks and not others?

He said in an interview with Reuters that customer Rakuten had Opus 4 coding for nearly seven hours, while an Anthropic researcher set up the AI model to play 24 hours of a Pokemon game. That's up from about 45 minutes of game play for its prior model Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Anthropic told MIT Technology Review , opens new tab .\\n\\\"For AI to really have the economic and productivity impact that I think it can have, the models do need to be able to work autonomously and work coherently for that (longer) amount of time,\\\" he said.

These initial reports were difficult to distinguish from normal variation in user feedback. By late August, the increasing frequency and persistence of these reports prompted us to open an investigation that led us to uncover three separate infrastructure bugs. To state it plainly: We never reduce model quality due to demand, time of day, or server load. The problems our users reported were due to infrastructure bugs alone. We recognize users expect consistent quality from Claude, and we maintain an extremely high bar for ensuring infrastructure changes don't affect model outputs.\\n ... \\nThe approximation works by accepting potential inaccuracies in the lowest probability tokens, which shouldn't affect quality\\u2014except when the bug caused it to drop the highest probability token instead. <sup>[4]</sup> Note that the now-correct top-k implementation may result in slight differences in the inclusion of tokens near the top-p threshold, and in rare cases users may benefit from re-tuning their choice of top-p.\\n\\n## Get the developer newsletter\\n\\nProduct updates, how-tos, community spotlights, and more.

The San Francisco-based company said its new AI model, the latest in a cascade of product releases from Silicon Valley, was also less likely than its prior technology to give offensive or dangerous responses. Businesses can launch products drawing on the model, and consumers in the U.S. and UK can chat with it [online , opens new tab](https://claude.ai/) . Previously Anthropic had limited access.

The immediate promise of such technology is to vastly speed up reading and writing tasks. This so-called generative AI, for instance, can draft blog posts or read and analyze existing text. One of the ways Anthropic aims to set itself apart from the competition is the ability of its system to read about 75,000 words at a time, which the company says lets the AI pore through long business documents. Interest in regulation meanwhile has surged globally following copyright concerns and common examples of AI's generating misinformation or other harmful content. Anthropic said in its upgrade of Claude it had doubled the model's performance on a safety evaluation. OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, has stayed at the front of the business pack. Unlike Claude, its recent GPT-4 model is \\\"multimodal,\\\" meaning it can respond not just to text but to images that humans give it.\"]}]}",
