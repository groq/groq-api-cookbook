# Mem0 + Groq Integration

This project demonstrates how to build high-performance, memory-augmented agents using **[Mem0](https://mem0.ai)** with **Groq**-accelerated LLMs.

Mem0 enables agents to persist and recall contextual memories, while Groq delivers ultra-fast inference using LPU-backed models. Combined, they provide the foundation for scalable and responsive intelligent systems.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Persistent Memory**: Store and retrieve chat history, context, and metadata for long-term recall.
- **Groq-Powered LLMs**: Integrate with blazing-fast models with near real-time response capabilities.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Swap model providers and tweak parameters with ease.
- **Semantic Memory Search**: Use OpenAI embeddings to fetch the most relevant past interactions.
