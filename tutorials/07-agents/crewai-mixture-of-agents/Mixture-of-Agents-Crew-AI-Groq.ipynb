    "In this notebook, we will showcase the concept of [Mixture of Agents (MoA)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.04692) using [Crew AI](https://www.crewai.com/) and [Groq API](https://console.groq.com/playground). The Mixture of Agents approach involves leveraging multiple AI agents, each equipped with different language models, to collaboratively complete a task. By combining the strengths and perspectives of various models, we can achieve a more robust and nuanced result. In our project, multiple MLB Writer agents, each utilizing a different language model (`llama3-8b-8192`, `gemma2-9b-it`, and `mixtral-8x7b-32768`), will independently generate game recap articles based on game data collected from other Crew AI agents. These diverse outputs will then be aggregated by an MLB Editor agent, which will synthesize the best elements from each article to create a final, polished game recap. This process not only demonstrates the power of collaborative AI but also highlights the effectiveness of integrating multiple models to enhance the quality of the generated content."

These tools are designed to fetch game information and player boxscores via the [MLB-Stats API](https://github.com/toddrob99/MLB-StatsAPI).
