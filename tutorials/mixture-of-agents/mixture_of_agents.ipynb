    "# Mixture of Agents Powered by Groq using Langchain LCEL\n",
    "\n",
    "Mixture of Agents (MoA) is an advanced approach in the field of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) that combines multiple AI models to produce more robust and comprehensive responses. This implementation showcases an agentic workflow, where multiple AI agents collaborate to solve complex tasks, leading to more nuanced and reliable outputs than single-model approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the implementation of a Mixture of Agents (MoA) architecture using Langchain and Groq. The MoA approach combines multiple open source models to produce responses that are on par or better than SOTA proprietary models like GPT4.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will walk you through how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up the environment and dependencies.\n",
    "2. Create helper functions.\n",
    "3. Configure and build the Mixture of Agents pipeline.\n",
    "4. Chat with the Agent.\n",

    "You can create a developer account for free at https://console.groq.com/ and generate a free API key to follow this tutorial!\n",

      "User: tell me about opentelemetry\n",
      "AI: OpenTelemetry is an open-source observability framework that provides a vendor-neutral, language-agnostic way to collect, transmit, and analyze telemetry data from applications. Its primary goal is to standardize telemetry instrumentation, making it easier to collect and analyze data from various sources and platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Components:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **APIs**: OpenTelemetry provides a set of APIs for various programming languages (e.g., Java, .NET, Python, Go) to instrument applications and generate telemetry data.\n",
      "2. **Collectors**: Collectors are responsible for collecting telemetry data from applications and sending it to a backend storage system, such as a database or an analytics platform.\n",
      "3. **Processors**: Processors can be used to transform, filter, or enrich telemetry data before it's sent to the collector or storage system.\n",
      "4. **SDKs (Software Development Kits)**: SDKs are language-specific implementations of the OpenTelemetry API, handling the details of collecting and exporting telemetry data.\n",
      "5. **Exporters**: Exporters send the collected telemetry data to your chosen observability backend.\n",
      "6. **Propagators**: Propagators ensure that trace context is carried across different services and components.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Benefits:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Vendor-Neutrality**: OpenTelemetry is not tied to a specific vendor or platform, making it a great choice for organizations with diverse technology stacks.\n",
      "2. **Standardization**: By using OpenTelemetry, developers can focus on instrumentation and data collection, rather than worrying about vendor-specific APIs or protocols.\n",
      "3. **Improved Observability**: OpenTelemetry enables organizations to collect and analyze telemetry data more effectively, providing valuable insights for monitoring, debugging, and optimizing their applications.\n",
      "4. **Reduced Vendor Lock-in**: OpenTelemetry allows developers to choose the best tools for their needs without being tied to a single platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Use Cases:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)**: OpenTelemetry can be used to collect data on application performance, latency, and errors, helping organizations identify bottlenecks and optimize their applications.\n",
      "2. **Log Collection and Analysis**: OpenTelemetry can be used to collect and analyze log data, providing insights into application behavior, errors, and security incidents.\n",
      "3. **Cloud Cost Optimization**: By collecting telemetry data on cloud resource usage, organizations can optimize their cloud costs and improve resource allocation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Implementation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Instrument Your Applications**: Use OpenTelemetry APIs to instrument your applications, generating telemetry data that can be collected and analyzed.\n",
      "2. **Configure Collectors**: Set up collectors to collect telemetry data from your applications and send it to a backend storage system or analytics platform.\n",
      "3. **Integrate with Analytics Platforms**: Integrate OpenTelemetry with your preferred analytics platform (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, New Relic) to visualize and analyze your telemetry data.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Challenges and Limitations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Instrumentation Complexity**: Instrumenting applications can be complex, especially for large-scale or legacy systems.\n",
      "2. **Data Volume and Complexity**: Collecting and analyzing large amounts of telemetry data can be challenging, requiring significant resources and expertise.\n",
      "3. **Security and Compliance**: OpenTelemetry may require additional security measures to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive data.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "\n",
      "OpenTelemetry is a powerful observability framework that can help organizations improve their application monitoring, debugging, and optimization capabilities. By understanding its components, benefits, use cases, implementation, and challenges, you can effectively leverage OpenTelemetry to drive better business outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "OpenTelemetry is backed by major players in the industry, including Google, Microsoft, and the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), ensuring its growth and long-term support. Using OpenTelemetry, developers can gain deep insights into their applications' performance, resource utilization, and potential issues, leading to more reliable and efficient systems.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In this notebook we demonstrated how to build a fairly complex agentic workflow using Groq's fast AI inference.\n",
    "MoA and other agentic workflows offer significant advantages in working with Large Language Models (LLMs). By enabling LLMs to \"think,\" refine their responses, and break down complex tasks, these approaches enhance accuracy and problem-solving capabilities. Moreover, they present a cost-effective solution by allowing the use of smaller, open-source models in combination, even when multiple LLM calls are required. This notebook serves as an introduction to agentic workflows and in production, should be adapted to your use case and evaluated thoroughly.\n",
